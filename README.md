## 👋 About Me

I returned from military service in January 2025 and decided to pursue a career in QA. I often notice usability issues in apps and websites and naturally think of ways to describe and improve them. My problem-solving skills align well with testing techniques like error guessing, and together with my technical background, this gives me a solid start in QA.

Currently, I am developing my skills through self-study and personal projects, focusing on test design, bug reporting, and QA processes. I am seeking an internship or junior QA role to apply my knowledge, contribute to product quality, and grow as a professional.
