### 👋 About Me

I returned from military service in January 2025 and decided to pursue a career in QA. I often notice usability issues in apps and websites and naturally think of ways to describe and improve them. My problem-solving skills align well with testing techniques like error guessing, and together with my technical background, this gives me a solid start in QA.

Currently, I am developing my skills through self-study and personal projects, focusing on test design, bug reporting, and QA processes. I am seeking an internship or junior QA role to apply my knowledge, contribute to product quality, and grow as a professional.

### 📁 Projects

Here are my practice projects where I apply my theoretical knowledge.
#### **[ArmTypingTest – Desktop Typing Speed Test Game](https://github.com/KhachatryanRafayel/ArmTypingTest)**
> Pet project for practicing QA skills
- Designed and executed test cases for core functionality (word generation, typing accuracy, result calculation)
- Created checklists for UI/UX elements (real-time feedback, visual cues, result screen)
- Reported and classified bugs found during testing, including:
	- Text input overflowing beyond input field when typing long strings
	- No error indication for incorrect word input (lack of visual feedback)
	- Continuous backspace not functioning properly (only deletes on single press)
- Applied functional and UI testing techniques
- Performed input validation and negative testing (e.g., long text input, continuous backspace behavior)
- Documented test results and defect reports for iterative improvements
