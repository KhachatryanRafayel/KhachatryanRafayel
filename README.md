## 👋 About Me

I am a QA engineer with experience in testing web applications, including exploratory, functional, and UI testing. I also write functional and regression automated tests using data-driven frameworks. I have worked with tools such as Selenium and PyTest to improve software quality and reduce release risks. I am eager to grow as an AQA engineer by mastering modern tools and methodologies, continuously enhancing my skills, and contributing to high-quality software delivery.
