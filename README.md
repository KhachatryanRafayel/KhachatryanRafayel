## 👋 About Me

Aspiring QA specialist with a passion for programming. I enjoy testing software, finding issues before they reach users, and understanding how code works under the hood. I have hands-on experience testing web applications, including exploratory, functional, and UI/UX testing. I’m eager to grow as a quality assurance engineer by mastering modern tools and methodologies, continuously improving my skills, and eventually transitioning into test automation.
